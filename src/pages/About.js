          I currently work as a front-end web developer in San Francisco, CA.
          I challenge myself to write elegant code as well as to keep up with the latest in web tooling and best practices.
          When I am not telling pixels what to do, I enjoy rock climbing, <a href="#" class="about-link">hip hop dancing</a>, getting lost in the city, finding the tastiest food, enjoying live <a href="#" class="about-link">music</a> and becoming more of a morning person.
          </p>
          </div>
            <a href="#/contact" class="contact-cta"><span>Say Hi!</span><i class="fa fa-envelope-o fa-fw"></i></a>
        </div>
      </section>
    );
  }
